# mod_roadmap
A module for easily publishing information on product features.

## Introduction

We wanted our customers give feedback and track progess on what we are
doing on our own website. We use http://zotonic.com as web framework so 
it was logical to create an easy to use roadmap module for zotonic.

## Roadmap Items

Roadmap items can have different stages.

 * Request feedback - The feature is explained, but not yet planned.
 * Planned - The feature is planned, and has a start and release date.
 * Released - The feature is released, and has a release date.
 * Archived - The feature never released, archive date.
